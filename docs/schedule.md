# How can i setup a night mode schedule?

Basically you can setup a automation that triggers a service call for every climate entity.
As a example you can use this blueprint:

<a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FKartoffelToby%2Fbetter_thermostat%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fblueprints%2Fnight_mode.yaml" target="_blank"><img src="https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg" alt="Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled." /></a>

```yaml
blueprint:
